What Is IAM?
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks.

Security Status

1. Delete your root access keys
2. Activate MFA on your root account
3. Create individual IAM users
4. Use groups to assign permissions
5. Apply an IAM password policy

Quiz : 15 Questions
#------------------------------------------------#
1. You are a security administrator working for a hotel chain. You have a new member of staff who has started as a systems administrator, and she will need full access to the AWS console. You have created the user account and generated the access key id and the secret access key. You have moved this user into the group where the other administrators are, and you have provided the new user with their secret access key and their access key id. However, when she tries to log in to the AWS console, she cannot. Why might that be?

1. You have not yet activated multi-factor authentication for the user, so by default they will not be able to log in.


2. Your user is trying to log in from the AWS console from outside the corporate network. This is not possible.


3. You cannot log in to the AWS console using the Access Key ID / Secret Access Key pair. Instead, you must generate a password for the user, and supply the user with this password and your organization's unique AWS console login URL.


4. You have not applied the "log in from console" policy document to the user. You must apply this first so that they can log in.
